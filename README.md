# PHP-Trivial-Chat-Web-Application
This is an application that I am writing mostly for practice
with PHP and somewhat for practice with MySQL and JSON.
The application will also use JavaScript, CSS, and (of course) HTML.

"jQuery Game Development Essentials" by Selim Arsever helped by introducing
me to the many ways in which I used PHP scripts in this program, such
as logging in and checking the user's session. The main menu in this
application is based on the one discussed by the aforementioned book
in its seventh chapter.

"Jump Start PHP" by Callum Hopkins helped by introducing me to WampServer
and PHPMyAdmin and by showing me how to use PDO for communicating
with MySQL databases.

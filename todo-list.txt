Next:
-remove storing of chat username in JavaScript code (since it's already
stored in PHP session)
-figure out why some messages aren't properly transferred
    --could give each message an id and have lastupdate store the last
    message id instead; at least for checking if multiple access of
    the database is the problem

Considerable:
-remove chat messages that can no longer be seen by anyone
-make username case-sensitive
-fix bug of not being able to put certain characters in usernames/passwords
    --use SQL parameters
    --apply to:
        --logging in
        --creating user

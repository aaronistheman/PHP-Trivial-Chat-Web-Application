Next:
-fix bug of not being able to put certain characters in message
    --use SQL parameters
-user can log out of chat room and go back to main menu
    --make sure to clear the update interval
-figure out why some messages aren't properly transferred
    --could give each message an id and have lastupdate store the last
    message id instead; at least for checking if multiple access of
    the database is the problem

Considerable:

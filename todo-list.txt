Next:
-other logged in users are notified of when someone entered; this
notification is simply added to the messages
    --do this for create user and for continued session
-fix bug of not being able to put certain characters in message
    --use SQL parameters
-user can log out of chat room and go back to main menu
    --make sure to clear the update interval
-figure out why some messages aren't properly transferred
    --could give each message an id and have lastupdate store the last
    message id instead; at least for checking if multiple access of
    the database is the problem

Considerable:
-remove chat messages that can no longer be seen by anyone

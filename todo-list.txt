Next:
-user can type messages and submit them; upon submission:
    --the message is stored in database
        --put the code that makes this database in setup.php
-on certain interval, an update function is called:
    --gets the messages that the client hasn't gotten yet, by comparing
    a timestamp stored with client
    --updates the timestamp
-other logged in users are notified of when someone entered and of
when that newly entered person last sent a message (unless he's a
new user)
-user can log out of chat room

Considerable:
-look into better password hashing options
-find a way to put the getJSON call and handling into one function
    --this includes error handling
-make Enter key in any text field result in clicking of a certain button
(whichever of the two buttons makes more sense)

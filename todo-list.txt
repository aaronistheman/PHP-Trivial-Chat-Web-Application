Next:
-user can type messages and submit them; upon submission:
    --store the message's timestamp in database
    --specify max message length to user; could say remaining characters
-getting others' messages to the user:
    --update the user's lastupdate when he logs in, so that he only
    gets messages that were sent after he logged in
    --on certain interval, an update function is called:
        --gets the messages that the client hasn't gotten yet, by comparing
        a timestamp stored with client
        --updates the timestamp
-other logged in users are notified of when someone entered; this
notification is simply added to the messages
-user can log out of chat room
-remove chat messages that can no longer be seen by anyone

Considerable:
-look into better password hashing options
-find a way to put the getJSON call and handling into one function
    --this includes error handling
-make Enter key in any text field result in clicking of a certain button
(whichever of the two buttons makes more sense)

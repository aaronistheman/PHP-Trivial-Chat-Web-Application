Next:
-make Enter key in any text field result in clicking of a certain button
(whichever of the two buttons makes more sense)
-other logged in users are notified of when someone entered; this
notification is simply added to the messages
-user can log out of chat room and go back to main menu
    --make sure to clear the update interval
-figure out why some messages aren't properly transferred
    --could give each message an id and have lastupdate store the last
    message id instead; at least for checking if multiple access of
    the database is the problem

Considerable:
-remove chat messages that can no longer be seen by anyone

Next steps:

Things to implement:
-make menus stack on top of each other
    --user has option to continue session, if applicable, and to log out
    --improve look of menu buttons and maybe the text fields, too
-find a way to put the getJSON call and handling into one function
    --this includes error handling
-user can type messages and submit them
    --upon submission, that user's last message sent time is updated
-other logged in users are notified of when someone entered and of
when that newly entered person last sent a message (unless he's a
new user)
-upon signing in, user is then able to receive messages sent by other
clients to the server
-user can log out
-nice looking text field and submit button

Considerable:
-look into better password hashing options
